**Step 1**: Place the biscuits into a freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin. Be careful not to break up too much as you will want some larger pieces not just crumbs.

**Step 2**: Gently melt the butter or margarine in a large saucepan. Break up the chocolate and add along with the golden syrup. Keep the heat very low and stir constantly until everything is combined and the chocolate has totally melted. Leave to cool in the pan.

**Step 3**: Add all the ingredients into the cooled chocolate mixture and stir until everything is coated.

**Step 4**: Tip the mixture into the lined tin and spread out. Chill for at least 2 hours (it'll be worth the wait, trust us).

**Step 5:** Remove from the tin and place on a board. Remove the paper lining, dust with icing sugar and cut into bars.
